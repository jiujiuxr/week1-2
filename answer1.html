        <h2>1. Cloud Platforms and AI Dataset Storage/Processing</h2>
        <p>The cloud platform provides scalable distributed storage systems, which can process a large number of structured and non-compatible data. These platforms usually include services such as object storage and database solutions that are optimized and optimized. In addition, they provide high-performance computing resources, such as GPUs and TPUs for processing and analyzing data. Built in data pipelines, ETL tools, and integration with the big data framework further simplify the storage and processing of big data sets, thereby meeting the needs of AI projects for storage and computing capabilities.    
        </p>
        <h2>2.Web Applications for AI User Interfaces</h2>
        <p>Web applications can access and interact interfaces by providing intuitive, access and interactive interfaces, as a bridge between complex AI models and end users. They enable users to enter data in real time. The functions of AI-driven can interact, access without in depth technical knowledge. Users can be easily used, and the use of users can easily use, web, applications, and AI services. Dynamic updates and maintenance are allowed to update and maintain these interfaces at the same time.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Cloud Services and AI Scalability</h2>
        <p>Cloud services support AI scalability by providing highly scalable computing resources. They can dynamically adjust resources based on real time data volume to ensure seamless performance. They make the AI project expand or vertical according to the level of workload demand. Real time data processing is supported by the automatic group of automatic groups that controls Kafka, without server computing and machine learning pipelines. This elasticity can ensure that a large amount of real time data can be processed and analyzed without relegation or manual intervention.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Web Applications and AI Model Integration</h2>
        <p>The web application promotes the integration of AI models to the end user environment by providing seamless interfaces for interactive interaction. They allow users to access AI functions without technical professional knowledge, thereby enhancing the applicability of the real world. They provide API, SDK, and user centric instrument panels, which can seamlessly integrate the AI model into the existing workflow, device or other software ecosystems. By embedding the model into the web application, enterprises can directly automate decision making in its operating environment to generate feasible insights or enhance user experience. 
        </p>
        <h2>5. Cloud-Based AI Services for Model Training/Deployment/Monitoring</h2>
        <p>Cloud-based AI services simplify model training, deployment and surveillance by providing strong infrastructure and tools. They provide scalable resources, pre-constructed AI services, and monitoring functions to simplify the entire AI life cycle. For example, AWS SAGEMAKER, Google Vertex AI and Azure Machine Learning can simplify the end-to-end life cycle of the AI â€‹project by providing a pre-configured environment, automation workflow and integrated surveillance tools. These services support effective model training, access to computing resources on demand, one-click deployment to the production environment and real-time monitoring performance and error detection.
